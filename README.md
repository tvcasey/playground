# reactPlayground

The objective of this repo is to practice my coding skills, especially in a react.js environment.  There probably will be little ending cohesion in all of this.  I want to get better at react and JSX while styling things with bootstrap 4 and CSS.

I have to take my devCodeCamp foundation and fortify it with a project like this.  I believe I will also restart and continue my Node API project, which is more delinated at the same time.
